# ClimaApp
A simple weather app which grabs your location (or takes location input) and gives the temperature and weather type of that region.

## About ClimaApp ##

ClimaApp was the first Android App I used with explicitly required location permission from users. I also got to experiment with
the WeatherMaps API, which was a simple and easy-to-use Weather API for my app. 

## How I built ClimaApp ## 

ClimaApp gives users two main options - it can either use the user's location to fetch the temperature and weather information 
from WeatherMaps API, or it allows the user to input a specific location to search for. Getting user information and applying 
it with the API-specific query was a great learning experience since this skill can be used many times for various projects.

I relied heavily on a Udemy course for this project, which gave the skeleton code in order to make the app screens look nice. I
aso consulted YouTube frequently when I needed to understand how to do certain things in the process of creating the app.
